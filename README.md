# pytorch-vq-vae
My attempt at PyTorch implementation of VQ-VAE paper by AÃ¤ron van den Oord et al.
for audio ([Neural Discrete Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937)).

Status: IT DIDN'T WORK, AND I GAVE UP. Someone forked it, though, so I'm not deleting this repo so as not to destroy the fork in case they need it.
## Requirements

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notebook

See [vq-vae.ipynb]
